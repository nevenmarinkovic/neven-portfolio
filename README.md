# Project Proposal
Upon reading through the final project overview on our class's website, I was not feeling enthused to spend more time with p5.js. I reached out to Corey and asked him if I could work on a personal portfolio website instead. I've been wanting to create a personal website for quite some time and thought that it was fitting for this class as it's both coding and creative. 

1.  For my final project, I'd like to develop the UI for my personal website. Since this class is focused on creative coding, I figured I'd focus on that aspect of the website. Additionally, full development and deployment of a website is outside the level of effort for this project. While I plan on doing that someday, I want to focus on the UI for now. Specifically, I'd like to develop and work on the following pages:
* Home page
* About page
* Experience pages (layout only). Since I have a handful of experiences I want to include on this site, there's a lot of writing to be done. I'd like to get the general layout of these pages down before I add content.
2. I've looked at square spaces portfolio examples for inspiration (https://www.squarespace.com/templates/browse/topic/all-templates/type/portfolio) as well as designed my own web pages using Lucid chart before developing.
3. I did some research and learned that Next.js and tailwind.css are common tools used to build dynamic websites. Even though I'm just displaying static content (for now), I wanted to push myself to learn something new with this framework. I haven't had a ton of experience with HTML/CSS/JS in general, so there will be some new things I learn through this project as well.
4. The following are the self-imposed deadlines for my project that will help me complete my project on time:
* Monday 4/28 - Complete initial website set up and home page design
* Friday 5/2 - Complete about me and experience page layout design
* Monday 5/5 - Complete final design checks and report write up
5. This week I completed the initial set up and completed my home page design.



## App Details

## To-do
* Think about paragraph formatting on about and experience pages. Make sure to break up the text. Increase font size?
* Make the app flexible for mobile formats

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Uploading to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Updates"
git push -u origin main

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
